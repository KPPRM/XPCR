{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellInSpace = Judging by the presence of so many craters, this planet has seen better days.
		RichellInSpace = It would be best to land on the massive supercontinent spanning the equator.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[evaReport]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellSrfLanded = The atmospheric conditions here remind you of home.
		RichellSrfLanded = You ask Mission Control if you can remove your helmet, but they advise against it as there is no oxygen in the atmosphere.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellInSpace = The Goo has hardened into a lump and is glowing green.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellSrfLanded = The surface is covered in fine sand, with occassional large rocks. You find the samples to be radioactive.
		RichellSrfSplashed = Whatever liquid this is, it certainly isn't water.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellSrfLanded = The materials are reacting to the high levels of radiation.
		RichellSrfLanded = The materials bay has filled up with sand blown in off the surface.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		Richell = Temperature scans throughout the atmosphere seem to suggest the existance of a troposhere, stratosphere and mesosphere.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[BarometerScan]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellFlyingLow = The atmosphere is thick enough to sustain flight, but contains no oxygen making jet engines useless.
		RichellSrfLanded = The atmosphere on Richell is slightly thicker than that back home.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellSrfLanded = This planet has been geologically inactive for millions of years.
		RichellSrfLanded = Changes in the speed of vibrations suggest there are different layers of material underneath the surface.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellInSpace = Based on gravitational scans, you can interpolate the mass of the planet.
		RichellSrfLanded = The force of gravity here is much lower than on Kerbin.
	}
}
@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]:FOR[XPCR]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		RichellSrfLanded = The atmosphere here is similar to Kerbin in that it is nitrogen-rich, but unfortunately lacks the oxygen required to sustain life.
		RichellSrfLanded = You would surely suffocate if you removed your helmet here, but at least the atmospheric pressure wouldn't boil your saliva or make your eyeballs explode.
