{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluInSpace = Large patches of the surface are frozen like Eeloo, but most of the surface is rocky.
		AluInSpace = You reckon landing in one of the craters may be a good idea.	
		
		EelooFlyingHigh = Eeloo's tenuous atmosphere has no noticeably effect on your flight at this altitude.
		EelooFlyingLow = The atmosphere is so thin that parachutes would be useless.
		
		BerosInSpace = It looks like a captured asteroid.
		BerosInSpace = Although it isn't green, you like the colour of the moon's surface.

		KyxInSpace = It looks very strangely shaped. You note the how much the poles seem to stick out.
		KyxInSpace = The surface seems very lumpy, and has an interesting colour.

		MaximusInSpace = If you were even more tired then you already are you might belive that Maximus is Gilly's moon

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluSrfLanded = You look up in the sky to see if you can see Eeloo.
		
		BerosSrfLanded = The low surface gravity reminds you of Gilly.
		
		KyxSrfLanded = There are many rocks scattered across the surface.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluInSpace = The Goo would much rather be on Eeloo.
		
		BerosInSpace = The Goo feels uncomfortable.
		
		KyxInSpace = The Goo takes on a lumpy shape.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluSrfLanded = The soil found here is identical in composition to Eeloo's, although without as much ice.
		AluSrfLanded = You chip away at the ice. Analysis reveals it to be frozen nitrogen.

		BerosSrfLanded = Beros is completely unlike the other bodies in this system of moons.
		
		KyxSrfLanded = Soil analysis reveals that Kyx is likely an ejected piece of the dwarf planet it orbits.

		MaximusSrfLanded = You try to fgure out how maximus hasn't been torn apart be eeloo-alu

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluSrfLanded = Half of the liquid samples freeze solid while the rest evaporate.
		
		EelooFlying = The samples seem confused that there is an atmosphere.
		
		BerosSrfLanded = A few of the samples sublimate into a gas and float off into space.
		
		KyxSrfLanded = The samples float around. A few glow slightly.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[temperatureScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
	EelooSrfLanded = It's very cold, colder than it is higher in the atmosphere.

}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluFlyingLow = Unlike Eeloo, there is no atmosphere here.
		AluSrfLanded = You detect an incredibly tenuous ammount of nitrogen gas, but nothing close to a proper atmosphere.

}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		KyxSrfLanded = You detect absolutely nothing.
		
		AluSrfLanded = The planet is geologically dead. There is zero seismic activity.
		
		BerosSrfLanded = The sensor records a few vibrations and then nothing. You realize it was just from the craft settling on the surface.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		KyxInSpace = Because of it's distance from the other bodies, Kyx's gravity has a large sphere of influence.
		KyxSrfLanded = The moon's gravity fluctuates depending on where you scan from.
		
		AluInSpace = Eeloo has a strong graviational pull on Alu.
		AluSrfLanded = Graviational scans seem to indicate a center of mass that exists between Alu and Eeloo.
		
		BerosInSpace = Beros' gravity is too weak to form the body into a sphere.
		BerosSrfLanded = You reckon it would be easy to get back into orbit, based on the low gravity.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[atmosphereAnalysis]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		AluSrf = You pick up trace ammounts of nitrogen gas.
		
		KyxSrf = You're not sure why you brought an atmosphere analyser here, because there is obviously no atmosphere.
		
		BerosSrf = The scanner seems upset with you for using it where there is no atmosphere.
