		MiosSrfLanded = You pick up a clump of ice and dirt. Preliminary test indicate that the soil has high levels of salts present, which explains why the water doesn't freeze.
		MiosSrfSplashed = You've taken a sample of water. The salinity of the sample explains how the oceans stay liquid in such a cold place.
		MiosSrfSplashed = When you peer through the microscope, the water is teeming with microbial life! You wonder how do they even survive in this cold and salty place.

		MiosSrfLanded = The electronics are freezing solid. Hopefully this doesn't affe%/34r83y##'
		MiosSrfSplashed = The electronics are getting wet and some of the metallic samples are rusting. The other samples are being violently attacked by the salt.
