{
	@RESULTS
	{

		NykeInSpaceHigh = Nyke almost looks like it's orbiting Ike instead of Duna.
		NykeInSpaceLow = It looks like a potato due to it's oblate shape.
		
		NykeSrfLanded = Both Duna and Ike remain stationary in the sky.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpaceHigh= Neither Duna nor Ike seem to move that much in the sky.
		NykeInSpaceHigh = Nyke almost looks like it's orbiting Ike instead of Duna.
		NykeInSpaceLow = It looks like a potato due to it's oblate shape.

		NykeSrfLanded = You feel like doing some honest work and planting some of those potatoes left in the fridge.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpaceHigh = The Goo turns red and evaporates into the vaccuum.
		NykeInSpaceLow = The Goo morphs into a potatoroid shape before evaporating into the vacuum.
		NykeSrfLanded = The Goo turns into a potato. It looks yummy.
		NykeSrfLanded = The Goo turns into a red potato. You wonder if its safe to eat it.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[surfaceSample]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeSrfLanded = The samples you gather are similar in composition to those from Duna.
		NykeSrfLanded = You gather up the nicest looking rocks you can find. They look similar to potatoes.
		NykeSrfLanded = You harvest the potatoes, hoping to make some fries. However, Mission Control points out that they're rocks and shouldn't be eaten.
	}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mobileMaterialsLab]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpaceHigh = You open the Material's bay door and watch for several minutes as nothing happens.
		NykeInSpaceLow = Upon opening the doors, some substances start developing a reddish hue, while the potato wobbles.
		NykeSrfLanded = The influence of the moon has somehow caused the potato to sprout. You try to plant it in the soil, only to realise there's no air here.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[barometerScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpace = The barometer reports that the surroundings are in vacuo. You wonder however whether the moon itself has an atmosphere.
		NykeSrfLanded = Your suspicions are proven wrong, for there is absolutely no atmosphere here.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[seismicScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeSrfLanded = The moon is being constantly pulled by Duna and Ike, leading to its shape.
		NykeSrfLanded = The seismometer detects constant low-level quakes, a result of the gravitational attraction of Duna and Ike.
	}
}

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpaceHigh = The scanner misreports gravitational data from Nyke, as it is confused by the gravitational pulls of Ike and Duna.
		NykeInSpaceLow = The sensor requires heavy calibration in order to work properly. It shows great variations in gravitational strength as it flies over the bulges.
		NykeSrfLanded = The sensor detects great differences in gravioli particles between the lowest and the highest points of this moon, and craves for some fries after work.
		NykeSrfLanded = The gravity scan shows the moon being constantly pulled by Duna and Ike, leading to its shape.
