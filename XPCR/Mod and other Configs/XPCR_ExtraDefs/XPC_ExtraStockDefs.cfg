{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeSrfLanded = The sample is a rather dark brown color, and if you were one of those geologist types you'd probably say something about silicates. To you, though, it just looks like a chunk of space potato.
		AdenSrfLanded = Aden's yellow-green coloration is likely due to sulfur compounds.
		NeithSrfLanded = The analysis tells you that the sample is comprised of neptunite and sugilite, diluted by more common silicates. This is probably why it's purple.
		IberSrfLanded = The surface of Iber is mostly made of silicates and fine sand, but there's a concerning quantity of radioactive substances within as well.

	{
		NykeInSpace = They lied. It's even MORE potato-y than you were led to believe!
		NykeSrfLanded = From here, Ike and Duna seem to be locked in the same relative position to each other. It's a very unusual sight, and well worth the trip out here!
		AdenInSpace = Now, that's a wholesome moon.
		AdenSrfLanded = The crew remarks that they feel welcomed.
		NeithInSpace = Well, it's sort of purple...
		NeithSrfLanded = It feels a lot like it did in orbit.
		SercSrfLanded = The small asteroid's gravity offers very little comfort for your gravity-starved bones, but you take what you can get.
		GlacSrfLanded = The craft shifts suddenly! You hope the surface won't crack and give out...
		IberInSpace = Well, it's brown.
		IberSrfLanded = Judging from the shared colors of both these bodies, the apple doesn't fall far from the tree, does it?
		RichellSrfSplashed = There's no way these brown oceans are water.
		RichellSrfLanded = Well, if there's one color you're not very fond of, it's brown.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[evaReport]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpace = The potato moon's oblate shape is apparent from here. If you had to guess, tidal forces from its companions tugging at it probably made it look like that.
		NykeSrfLanded = Nyke's surface itself doesn't seem to be very interesting, but the view overhead most certainly is.
		AdenInSpace = The green moon of Aden seems like such a nice place compared to Eve...
		AdenSrfLanded = The sight of Eve hanging in the sky like that is quite a beautiful one!
		NeithInSpace = You're pretty sure you could head down for a landing and come back up without even needing to use a spacecraft- just your rocket pack.
		NeithSrfLanded = It occurs to you that landing legs wouldn't really be very helpful here. A harpoon, perhaps?
		IberInSpace = Isn't that potato joke getting old? Every one of these captured asteroids could be mistaken for a spud.
		RichellInSpace = It looks... brown.
		RichellSrfSplashed = You feel... filthy.
		RichellSrfSplashed = Ew, why are you swimming in it?!
		RichellSrfLanded = Okay, maybe brown isn't THAT bad. The sepia colors do have a certain appeal to them.
		RichellSrfLanded = Actually, this is kind of alright. Richell is a pretty weird place- and you like weird places. Jeb's parties are weirder, though.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[mysteryGoo]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpace = The Goo says it likes potatoes. You make a note of the fact that you were not previously informed the Goo could speak, and decide to seek heart medication.
		NykeSrfLanded = The Goo forms into an oblate pancake shape, seemingly to imitate Nyke.
		AdenInSpace = The Goo pops a bubble on its surface to imitate an explosion.
		AdenSrfLanded = The Goo makes a nose and plugs it with a pseudopod.
		NeithInSpace = The Goo seems disinterested.
		NeithSrfLanded = The Goo seems to do a little dance as it 'bonces' around the container. Mission Control corrects your pronounciation, but you are adamant about it.
		IberInSpace = The Goo has turned brown.
		IberSrfLanded = The Goo wants to go home.
		RichellSrfSplashed = The Goo looks as if it's about to escape the container and slip into the liquid, but decides against it the moment it touches the surface.
		RichellSrfLanded = The Goo seems to be avoiding the planet's surface like one would avoid a pile of feces.

	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpace = The materials react to the situation in the way that materials would be expected to react to the situation of being above the surface of Nyke.
		NykeInSpace = The materials like Nyke, but they don't quite like Nyke like they like Ike.
		NykeSrfLanded = A plant sample begins to shed spores!
		NykeSrfLanded = The materials manage to achieve the incredible feat of doing ABSOLUTELY NOTHING.
		AdenInSpace = The materials do not react to the situation.
		AdenInSpace = Glass containers with several different compounds explode for no reason, sending a multicolored fireball shooting out of the materials bay.
		AdenSrfLanded = The materials seem to think about it for a few seconds, and all decide to explode together.
		AdenSrfLanded = Even the non-volatile samples just explode out of nowhere!
		NeithInSpace = For a moment it seems almost as if two of the samples are about to do something, but 'Neith-er' of them react.
		NeithSrfLanded = Even 'be-Neith' intense observation, the materials bay does nothing.
		IberInSpace = The materials are bored.
		IberSrfLanded = The samples are more preoccupied with the view of the planet from here, and forget they're supposed to react to the situation.
		RichellInSpace = The materials don't like sand.
		RichellSrfSplashed = Some of the materials start to dissolve in the liquid...
		RichellSrfLanded = The sand is coarse, rough, and it gets everywhere- all over the samples!

{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpaceLow = Nyke definitely has a temperature. However, you're not getting any closer to measuring that with this stupid thing.
		NykeSrfLanded = The surface temperature of Nyke would be nice to know, but thermometers don't function in a vacuum.
		AdenInSpaceLow = This would be a good time to remind you to bring some other means of determining temperature.
		AdenSrfLanded = The thermometer appears to be defiantly inert.
		NeithInSpaceLow = This was your plan?
		NeithSrfLanded = ...
		IberInSpaceLow = Mission Control reminds you that space can't have a temperature, since there's nothing in it.
		IberSrfLanded = 7
		RichellInSpaceLow = Well, somehow you manage to capture a few of the particles from Richell's atmosphere, and determine that they're really cold.
		RichellFlyingHigh = Chilly!
		RichellFlyingLow = Still chilly.
		RichellSrfLanded = Frosty!
		RichellSrfSplashed = Toasty...? No, frosty.

@EXPERIMENT_DEFINITION[*]:HAS[#id[gravityScan]]
{
	@RESULTS
	{
		NykeInSpaceHigh = You detect mostly the mixture of negative gravioli particles emitting from Duna and Ike, and they seem to fluctuate regularly. Nyke has little to do with this reading.
		NykeInSpaceLow = Even this close to it, you barely register any invisible gravity pasta emitting from Nyke.
		NykeSrfLanded = Gravitation here is quite measurable, but at only about 0.022 gees at 'sea level', there's not much to measure.
		AdenInSpaceHigh = Fluctuations in the gravitational field are observed as Aden's gravity interacts with the powerful pull of Eve.
		AdenInSpaceLow = Despite being so close to Aden, Eve's strong gravity emits a lot of gravioli, making it hard for the sensor to take an accurate reading.
		AdenSrfLanded = After landing on Aden, the gravioli detector can take an accurate measurement of the gravioli emission of Aden.
		NeithInSpaceHigh = The sensor doesn't detect anything.
		NeithInSpaceLow = The error handler built into the gravioli detector seems to disregard the miniscule pull coming from Neith as an error, and registers nothing until you knock some sense into it.
		NeithSrfLanded = The detector doesn't seem quite sure that the gravity here is real, but you reassure it.
		IberInSpaceHigh = The sensor only registers Richell's gravity at this altitude.
		IberInSpaceLow = The gravioli detector asserts that there's a moon below, but points in the opposite direction to where Iber actually is.
		IberSrfLanded = This time, the gravioli detector correctly guesses where the moon is, but seems to think that the center of the body is 126 kilometers off the surface of the planet, on the opposite side...

		RichellFlyingHigh = At such an altitude, it's difficult to get an accurate reading of the atmospheric composition, but there's a lot of nitrogen.

		NeithSrfLanded = For a moment, the seismometer breifly registers a tiny little bonk on the other side of the moon, likely a micrometeorite impact.
		IberSrfLanded = It has a seismic activity rating of seven. That is, on a scale of five hundred thousand.
