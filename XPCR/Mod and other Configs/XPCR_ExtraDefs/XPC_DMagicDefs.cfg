		NykeInSpace = Magnetism in this part of space just isn't very popular, is it?
		NykeSrfLanded = Nyke actually has a bit of a magnetic field going on at the surface, likely just generated by iron compounds inside and the same tidal forces that likely stretched it into its distinctive potato shape.
		AluInSpace = A magnetic field this aint'.
		AluSrfLanded = There appears to be a faint magnetosphere, indicating some kind of presence of heavier metals.
		BerosInSpace = Beros seems to have quite a pronounced magnetic field for such a small moon. It's possible that its surface has a very high iron content- or even that it's mostly iron.
		BerosSrfLanded = The magnetosphere at the surface here is definitely measurable, although it's weak, it's much, much stronger than you'd expect for a body of this size.
		KyxInSpace = The lumpy rock appears to be magnetically dead.
		KyxSrfLanded = Nothing changes on the surface from orbit- no magnetism is detectable.
		AdenInSpaceHigh = All that's detected is Eve's overpowering magnetosphere.
		AdenInSpaceLow = This close, Aden does appear to be causing distortion in Eve's magnetic field.
		AdenSrfLanded = Aden's magnetic field is definitely present and strong here, suggesting the prevalence of iron beneath its surface.
		NeithInSpace = Sorry, nothing but Eve's magnetic field.
		NeithSrfLanded = The magnetometer is snoring.
		MiosInSpaceHigh = This far up, it's still clear Mios has a significant magnetosphere, suggesting that the core is still active.
		MiosInSpaceLow = Mios' magnetosphere at this distance even outshines Kerbin's! It's probable that Mios has an active iron core even now, rather like Kerbin.
		MiosSrfLanded = The planet's magnetic field is definitely stronger than that of Kerbin. It's likely that this combined with its distance from the sun shields it quite well from harmful radiation, especially if the atmosphere is helping too.
		MiosSrfSplashed = Oddly, the equatorial ocean has higher magnetic activity than expected. There may be some unknown process keeping the magnetic field stronger here than in other places, and it may even be related to why this ocean is equatorial in the first place.
		GlacInSpace = The only magnetic activity here is coming from Mios.
		GlacSrfLanded = This icy moon doesn't appear to have a magnetosphere.
		SercInSpace = It doesn't seem like Serc generates a magnetic field.
		SercSrfLanded = Even on the surface, the magnetometer seems to be bored.
		Iber = So what you're saying is that lumps of silicate rock and carbon don't have much magnetic activity? You don't say.
		RichellInSpaceHigh = There doesn't appear to be a very strong magnetic field from this distance, but the planet is so far from the sun that it could feasibly maintain a substantial atmosphere anyway.
		RichellInSpaceLow = The magnetosphere detected here is relatively strong, but not nearly as much as other terrestrial planets, minus Duna.
		RichellSrfLanded = From here, it's clear Richell has enough of a magnetic field to deflect most solar particles that would blast its atmosphere away.

		AdenInSpace = Aden's yellowish, sulfurous surface absorbs more light than it reflects.
		NeithInSpace = 'Neith-er' UV nor IR light is reflected very strongly by Neith.
		MiosInSpaceHigh = Mios' IR-absorbing equatorial ocean reduces its albedo somewhat, but the reflective quality of its tundra gives it a rather high albedo.
		MiosInSpaceLow = The reflective qualities of Mios somewhat outstrip Kerbin, especially when the sensor is pointed at its tundra.
		GlacInSpaceHigh = The icy moon's albedo is extremely high in the visible spectrum, although its watery surface absorbs most red wavelengths.
		GlacInSpaceLow = So much light is reflected that it's difficult to take a proper image of it in the visible spectrum. The sensors have an easier time with invisible light, though.
		SercInSpaceHigh = Taters.
		SercInSpaceLow = Potatoes do not have a very high albedo.
		IberInSpace = I'm not sure what you expected. Low albedo.

		BerosSrfLanded = Your suspicions were confirmed- Beros is very much unlike other bodies this far away from the sun in that its composition is over half iron!
		KyxSrfLanded = Although the color is slightly odd, Kyx' surface composition is less odd, being a mixture of silicate rock and water ice characteristic of objects in this area of space.
		AdenSrfLanded = The yellow rock you vaporize combusts, exploding and sending debris everywhere! That chunk must have been predominantly sulfur.
		NeithSrfLanded = The purple surface appears to be a mixture of neptunite and sugilite, but the color is paled by more common silicates.
		MiosSrfSplashed = Although the ocean was initially thought to be water heated by some tidal force, it's actually shown to instead have very high salinity.
		MiosSrfLandedBeaches = It seems the entire solid surface of Mios is coated in a fine layer of water ice.
		MiosSrfLandedTundra = This icy plain seems to mostly be silicate sand, coated in water ice.
		MiosSrfLandedIce = The ice at Mios' poles has become very thick, and the laser detects little more than slightly salty water ice.
		GlacSrfLanded = You vaporize the ice, confirming that the surface is mostly water ice in composition, with very little else present.
		SercSrfLanded = After analysis of the flashes created from zapping it, you wonder why silicates are so in these days.

		AluSrfLanded = The surface sample from Alu returns nothing of any apparent interest.
		BerosSrfLanded = The drill has a hard time gathering a sample, but what it could retrieve was largely iron and silicates.
		KyxSrfLanded = This little moon is only typical in composition, with a mixture of water ice and silicate rocks.
		AdenSrfLanded = The sample appears to be largely composed of the sulfurous mineral, pyrite.
		AdenSrfLanded = This sample is mostly common silicates, but there's a touch of iron in it.
		AdenSrfLanded = You return the sample and discover it to be made of rather pure sulfur, making it dangerously combustible.
		NeithSrfLanded = It seems no matter where you pick a sample from, the surface of Neith is mostly neptunite and sugilite, diluted by common silicates.
		MiosSrfSplashed = The water sample appears to be extremely salty rather than being warmed by internal processes, explaining why it's liquid but not why it's all concentrated in an equatorial band.
		MiosSrfLandedBeaches = The sample returned is comprised mostly of fine quartz, silicates, and water ice alongside significant salt deposits.
		MiosSrfLandedTundra = Although most of the white substance is ice, there are also chunks of salt embedded in this sample.
		MiosSrfLandedIce = A majority of the surface sample from Mios' poles is water ice with a slightly high salt content.
		GlacSrfLanded = The sample is over 90% water ice, and the remaining 10% appears to be a mixture of various silicates and tiny traces of heavier elements.
		SercSrfLanded = This sample would be fascinating if it was interesting.
		IberSrfLanded = Although the normal composition of silicates is boring, what's not so boring is the fact that there are traces of uranium and blutonium here!
		RichellSrfLanded = The brown world gets its color from silicate rock without a doubt, but it's also host to a little bit of radioactive materials, such as uranium, blutonium, and a tiny bit of thorium in this sample.

		NykeInSpace = The dead little rock does little to deflect the solar wind apart from just being in the way, parting the flow of charged particles like a tiny pebble parts the flow of a stream.
		AluInSpace = This far away from the sun, there are very few solar particles to even disturb.
		BerosInSpace = At such a distance, using this instrument seems to be very difficult as few particles even impact the wafers.
		KyxInSpace = Solar particle concentrations are already very low here; little Kyx isn't going to do much to change that.
		AdenInSpace = Eve's magnetic field manages to deflect a lot of the solar wind even this close to the sun, and Aden's mass only further assists that.
		NeithInSpace = This far away from Eve, solar particle density is much higher, and poor Neith is being blasted by it when it's not passing through Eve's magnetotail.
		MiosInSpaceHigh = Perhaps rather surprisingly, Mios is already deflecting much of the solar wind even this high up.
		MiosInSpaceLow = At this altitude, ammonia particles and nitrogen compounds are more common than solar wind. They likely originate from Mios' atmosphere.
		GlacInSpace = Water ice particles and traces of ammonia are detected here, and the solar wind seems almost totally absent. These likely originate from Mios' rings and Glac.
		SercInSpace = At this distance from Mios, solar particles are detected in substantial amounts, but the planet is still deflecting many of them.
		IberInSpace = Richell seems to deflect most of the solar wind here, and as such, you instead get details about its ring composition, concluding that much of it is silicate dust particles- though there are traces of radioactives, mainly blutonium.
		RichellInSpaceHigh = The solar wind is weak here, but that's normal for interplanetary space...
		RichellInSpaceLow = By this point, the wafers are detecting more of Richell's exosphere than solar particles. Nitrogen seems to be most prominent.

		NykeInSpace = A curiously well-ordered radio transmission seems to reflect off of Nyke. The signal, after some study, apparently came from Duna's south polar region. It almost sounds like slow-scan television...
		AluInSpace = Without any turbulent atmospheres nearby to generate radio waves with their storms, the only thing the sensor picks up are the plasma particles of the distant sun occasionally interacting with the magnetic environment.
		BerosInSpace = Beros has more of a magnetic field than the other objects here, probably because of extreme quantities of iron, so what few solar plasma particles there are to collect here interact strongly with it.
		KyxInSpace = Without any radio or plasma activity being generated out here, the only thing the RPWS instrument picks up are solar plasma particles.
		AdenInSpace = Radio waves emitted from the Sun are still clearly detectable here in significant quantities, but Eve is valiantly fighting them off with its powerful magnetosphere.
		NeithInSpace = Even this far away from Eve, the radio wave activity is significantly lower than in interplanetary space at the same distance from the sun.
		MiosInSpaceHigh = Radio wave activity from the sun is being largely deflected by Mios. Instead, the world itself is emitting patterns characteristic of lightning storms.
		MiosInSpaceLow = The planet below is causing significant radio activity, apparently because of a turbulent atmosphere.
		GlacInSpace = Glac has total radio silence. Everything detected here could only originate from Mios.
		SercInSpace = No unusual activity registers on the instrument- only the solar wind is measured out here.
		IberInSpace = Richell's respectable magnetic field gives the radio wave plasma science device plenty of data to analyse. It seems to have something of a Van Kerman radiation belt, which Iber orbits inside of. Either that, or the rings are slightly radioactive...
		RichellInSpaceHigh = It would seem that Richell doesn't have a lot of data to provide this far away.
		RichellInSpaceLow = Now that the sensors are so close, lightning whistler radio patterns are detected clearly at this distance, suggesting Richell's atmosphere is very turbulent.

		BerosSrfLanded = Even a seemingly-dry asteroid like Beros has a small amount of water ice lightly laid across its surface like a really cold blanket.
		KyxSrfLanded = Water ice deposits here likely originate mostly from impacts with external objects, and debris kicked up from similar impacts on the other bodies here.
