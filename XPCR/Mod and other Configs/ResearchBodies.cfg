	{
		Aden = What a pleasant green colour! If only Eve were as green as Aden.
		Neith = Not sure if this is a moon or a passing asteroid... Oh well, it's Neith now!
		
		Nyke = Nyke is personally my new favourite space potato.
		
		Beros = It's a captured asteroid, like Bop, but much, much farther away... Beros still looks like an intersting place though!
		Kyx = Should we even bother going here? It's so far... and tiny. There's not much else to say about Kyx.
		Alu = Can't believe we didn't see this earlier... Pardon my French, mais dit "salut" a Alu! Wait what is French?
		
		Richell = Those rings, and those oceans! Definitely marking Richell down as a vacation destination, hope the air is breathable...
		Iber = Iber isn't much, but I bet it offers a great view of Richell.
		
		Mios = So blue! And so cold looking... Took us a while to find Mios, but here it is.
		Serc = Serc has a very weird shape, and a very weird name.
		Glac = At first we thought this was just a rather large icy chunk floating in Mios' rings, but we suppose it's big enough to be a moon.
